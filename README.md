There's nothing innovative or interesting here.

These are just my personal efforts to learn more about machine learning
in Python.  Most of it is really learning Python by manipulating the
training data, and most of it mimics tools that already exist in Keras,
numpy, scikit-learn, and a bunch of other toolkits.  Hopefully by walking
through those processes that need those tools, I'll get a better
understanding of the tools themselves.
